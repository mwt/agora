# Jekyll Citations

Jekyll citations allows for a large yml dictionary of papers to be visualized and categorized in the form of a website. Most academic sites need to list and link to papers. This automatic formatting, generation, and alphabetization can be very helpful if you have a lot of papers.

I built this project as part of a research assistantship.
