# Hash Viewer

Hash viewer is an entirely client side tool to share snippets of markdown and LaTeX (for math). Because it has no server side components, the link must be processed entirely in browser using [[javascript]]. 

The tool must store all of the information in your document within the URL itself. The URLs can get very long, so it is only suitable for small documents. To keep the URL length down, I use efficient LZ-based compression. 

The entire project is hosted on GitHub pages. Hashes have to be viewed on the 404 page which is ~~ab~~used for this purpose.
